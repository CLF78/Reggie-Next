When the appropriate event has not been activated, or there is no corresponding event, [Never ON] then the water surface will appear [Distance] blocks higher. The water will then sink this many blocks, respecting any delays. After waiting for the delay at the bottom, the water surface will not rise again. Not exactly. Instead, it will 'skip' the rising part and 'jump' to immediately to the top. Additionally, using this with events will cause the water to rise, instead of falling. [ON] But the starting point is the same higher distance. The difference is that the water rises continuously as long as the event is enabled. [Endless Rising] If it is disabled, [OFF after ON] the water surface will 'jump' back to where it started and remain there until the event is re-enabled.
